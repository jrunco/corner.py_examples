# corner.py_examples
This repository gives examples for how to use corner.py in a couple new ways. 

I do not go over the basics of how to use the corner.corner() function, see the official Corner.py website for that information. Important disclaimer: I am not the creator of corner.py and do not claim any ownership over its maintenance. Note that these examples work using python 3 and corner v2.2.1 and may need to be altered for futuer corner.py versions
